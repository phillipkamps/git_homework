Success at Turing is dependent on dedication and self-motivation.
Turing shows you the door, you need to walk through, your hand will not be held.

I'm committed to trying to adhere to a strict calendar/ schedule.
I'll use the command line as often as possible.

My climbing partner and friend Steven has been very helpful the past few weeks and months. Thanks Steven!

Work together!
